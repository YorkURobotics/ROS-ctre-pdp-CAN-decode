# ROS PDP Decode

A ROS node to decode the CAN frames from the CTRE Power Distribution Panel. 

Development is still in progress

# TODO
- Add a service to clear sticky faults, and reset total energy
- Refactor code to reorganize it better
- Temp data seems to be a bit high - will need to verify that
